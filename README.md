# ToDoApp
A ToDo web app using Django rest framework API as backend and react as frontend

This web application uses a custom user model and JWT/Djoser authentication to register and login users.
It allows for the user to create their own todos, mark them as complete, delete them and update their description(work in progress)

Use the requirements.txt file in the ToDo folder to get all the necessary libraries.


# Still planned:
- change in appearence
- edit function for the todos
